Hey there! :wave: I'm Nikos, a Technology Consultant at Microsoft focusing on C# code and Azure cloud. I consider my shelf expert to nothing and I love my proffesion cause there is always something new to learn.

I am a familuy guy, wearing the hat of "Dad" of two kids, of one girl and one boy, who keep me on my toes and ensure there's never a dull moment in my day.

On my free time, you can find me lost in the pages of a heroic or horror fiction book :closed_book:, or sweating it out at the gym :muscle:.

Welcome to my blog, which will serve as my digital notebook :notebook_with_decorative_cover:.
